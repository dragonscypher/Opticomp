# Opticomp: The Efficiency Enhancer 🚀

## Welcome! 🙌
Hey, welcome to **Opticomp**! This isn't just another task manager; it's a real optimization tool. Whether your system's slowed down by resource-hogging apps or just needs a cleanup, **Opticomp** has you covered. With its easy-to-use UI, dark theme, and powerful features, you'll keep your PC running smoothly. 💻✨

## Key Features 🔑

- **Auto-Script Trigger** 🤖: When you start **Opticomp**, it automatically runs the scripts—no hassle, no manual work needed.

- **Remove Useless Apps** 🗑️: Opticomp helps you identify apps that use too many resources. It'll suggest apps to remove, and with one click, they’re gone.

- **Real-Time Usage Display** 📊: See charts showing which processes are using the most CPU and memory. Top 15 most demanding apps are visualized for easy understanding.

- **Smart Suggestions** 💡: We use machine learning to suggest which apps can be safely removed based on past usage. Important apps are safe, while unnecessary ones are flagged.

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Start the App** 🚀: When you open the app, it runs scripts to gather system information and process files to extract stats.
2. **Identify Issues** 🔍: **Opticomp** analyzes large file usage and uses an ML model to figure out what's slowing things down.
3. **Optimize** ✨: Get a list of unnecessary apps, see top resource users, and remove the ones you don’t need.

## Dependencies 📦
- Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **psutil**.
- **tkinter** for the user interface.
- **XGBoost** for smart suggestions.

## Usage 🚀
